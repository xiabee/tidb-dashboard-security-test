    ru_desc_line_1: Request Unit (RU) is a unified abstraction unit in TiDB for system resources, which is relavant to resource comsuption.
    ru_desc_line_2: Please notice the "estimated capacity" refers to a result that is hardware specs or past statistics, and may deviate from actual capacity.

    exceed_warning: The total RU of all customized resource groups exceeds the "estimated capacity". The RU allocated to some resource groups could not be satisfied.
    workload_select_tooltip: |
      Select a workload type which is similar with your actual workload.

      - **oltp_read_write**: applies to workloads with even data read and write. It is estimated based on a workload model similar to `sysbench oltp_read_write`
      - **oltp_read_only**: applies to workloads with heavy data read. It is estimated based on a workload model similar to `sysbench oltp_read_only`
      - **oltp_write_only**: applies to workloads with heavy data write. It is estimated based on a workload model similar to `sysbench oltp_write_only`
      - **tpcc**: applies to workloads with heavy data write. It is estimated based on a workload model similar to `TPC-C`
    time_window_select_tooltip: |
      Select the time window with classic workload in the past, with which TiDB can come a better estimation of RU capacity.

      Time window length: 10 mins ~ 24 hours
